## üìå About Cognifyz Technologies

Cognifyz Technologies is a leading technology company specializing in **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Analytics**. The company provides cutting-edge solutions and training programs to empower professionals and businesses.

## üìÇ Internship Task List

The internship program includes **four tasks**, out of which interns are required to complete **at least three**. Successful completion of all four tasks increases the chances of receiving a stipend.

### üèÜ Task 1: Predicting Restaurant Ratings
**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

**Steps:**
- Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, split data).
- Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression).
- Evaluate the model using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.
- Analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.

### üçΩÔ∏è Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System
**Objective:** Develop a recommendation system based on user preferences.

**Steps:**
- Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
- Define recommendation criteria (e.g., cuisine, price range).
- Implement a **content-based filtering** recommendation system.
- Test the system with sample user preferences and evaluate results.

### üçï Task 3: Cuisine Classification
**Objective:** Build a model to classify restaurants based on their cuisine types.

**Steps:**
- Preprocess the dataset and encode categorical variables.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluate performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, and recall**.
- Analyze classification performance and identify challenges.

### üìç Task 4: Location-Based Analysis
**Objective:** Perform a geographical analysis of restaurant locations.

**Steps:**
- Visualize restaurant distribution using latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Group restaurants by **city/locality** and analyze concentration.
- Compute statistics (average ratings, cuisine distribution, price ranges).
- Identify patterns and insights related to restaurant locations.
